# Scripts and Snippets for MikroTik RouterOS

This collection of scripts is meant to make your life easier when installing and maintaining RouterOS deployments. It is based on several best practices as gathered and discussed with network engineers, system integrators as well as the [MikroTik Forum Community](http://forum.mikrotik.com) and certified trainers from all around the world.

All scripts should be fairly well documented using inline documentation. Scripts that don't have any documentation go into the raw/ folder.

# Motivation

This repository was created based on the need of having a central spot on were I could store scripts and procedures related to RouterOS deployments. Majority of scripts were the result of me working on the network of [Foundation University](http://foundationu.com), [Dumaguete City, Philippines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumaguete). As of May 10th, 2015 FU is in the process of implementing an MPLS backbone with 30+ routers using the following models..

 * [CCR1036-8G-2S+EM](http://routerboard.com/CCR1036-8G-2SplusEM)
 * [CCR1036-12G-4S](http://routerboard.com/CCR1036-12G-4S)
 * [RB2011UiAS-RM](http://routerboard.com/RB2011UiAS-RM)
 * [CRS226-24G-2S+RM](http://routerboard.com/CRS226-24G-2SplusRM)
 * [RB951G-2HnD](http://routerboard.com/RB951G-2HnD)

If you're interested to know more about the network at FU I suggest you watch the following presentation held in Manila, December 2014 at the first [MikroTik User Meeting in the Philippines](http://mum.mikrotik.com/2014/PH/info).
