# MikroTik RouterOS: Collection of Scripts & Best Practices

This repository contains a collection of scripts that are meant to make your life easier when deploying and maintaining RouterOS based platforms. It uses best practices of network engineers, system integrators as well as members of the community reachable through the [MikroTik Forum](http://forum.mikrotik.com). 

# Motivation

I needed a place where to store some scripts. Most scripts are the result of my work at [Foundation University](http://foundationu.com) in [Dumaguete City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumaguete) where we operate an MPLS backbone and ISP with 50+ routers.

As of March 2016 the following models are used within our environment..

 * [CCR1036-8G-2S+EM](http://routerboard.com/CCR1036-8G-2SplusEM)
 * [CCR1036-12G-4S](http://routerboard.com/CCR1036-12G-4S)
 * [RB2011UiAS-RM](http://routerboard.com/RB2011UiAS-RM)
 * [RB3011UiAS-RM](http://routerboard.com/RB3011UiAS-RM)
 * [CRS226-24G-2S+RM](http://routerboard.com/CRS226-24G-2SplusRM)
 * [RB951G-2HnD](http://routerboard.com/RB951G-2HnD)

If you're interested in our setup feel free to watch the following:

This presentation took place in Manila in December 2014 as part of the first [MikroTik User Meeting in the Philippines](http://mum.mikrotik.com/2014/PH/info).
