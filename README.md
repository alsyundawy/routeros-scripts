# Scripts and Snippets for MikroTik RouterOS

This repository holds a collection of scripts meant to make your life easier when deploying and maintaining RouterOS. It is based on best practices of network engineers, system integrators as well as members of the community reachable through the [MikroTik Forum](http://forum.mikrotik.com). 

# Motivation

I needed a place where to share best practices with the public. Many scripts are part of my work at [Foundation University](http://foundationu.com) in [Dumaguete City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumaguete). Our university is in the process of implementing an MPLS backbone with 70+ routers based on the following models..

 * [CCR1036-8G-2S+EM](http://routerboard.com/CCR1036-8G-2SplusEM)
 * [CCR1036-12G-4S](http://routerboard.com/CCR1036-12G-4S)
 * [RB2011UiAS-RM](http://routerboard.com/RB2011UiAS-RM)
 * [CRS226-24G-2S+RM](http://routerboard.com/CRS226-24G-2SplusRM)
 * [RB951G-2HnD](http://routerboard.com/RB951G-2HnD)

This talk was given in Manila, December 2014 as part of the first [MikroTik User Meeting in the Philippines](http://mum.mikrotik.com/2014/PH/info).
